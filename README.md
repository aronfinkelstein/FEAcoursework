FEA coursework - TB1 ASM

## About

The formative folder contains a script (simple_beam_calcs) to be used to calculate the analytical solutions to the part 1 problem, and a script (model_anbalysis) to be used to analyise the effects of different seed sizing on model accuracy.

## Use

To install requirements, use the following terminal command after creating a virtual environment:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The modelparams.csv file contains the results for my investigation of modelling. It can be used as a template.
